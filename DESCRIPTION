Description: Functions produced by Philip Merrill College's Howard Center for
	Investigative Journalism to process temperature information collected by
	temperature sensors. Two functions, one for R outputs and one for Excel, will
	analyze your chosen file and output tables and graphs. The Excel version is
	intended for those who are unfamiliar with R, while the R version will allow users
	to manipulate the cleaned data in R. 
	You will need to use the code install_github("tdiffendal/tempsensorr") to install.
	install_github requires the library devtools.
